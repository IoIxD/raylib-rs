# rres-rs

rres-rs is a Rust binding for [rres](https://github.com/raysan5/rres/) 1.2.0. It currently targets Rust toolchain version 1.78 or higher.

Please checkout the showcase directory to find usage examples!

Though this binding tries to stay close to the simple C API, it makes some changes to be more idiomatic for Rust.

rres can be used standalone or with *raylib-rs*: using the `raylib` feature flag will add the appropriate functions to RaylibHandle.
